This project was intended to be an enhanced version of the rebble-asr service,
featuring streaming transcriptions as originally intended by Pebble.

However, since the latency improvements are unlikely to be significant (the existing
service is pretty fast already), and the complexity is notably greater, it lies
abandoned and is recorded here for posterity.
